Machine learning is becoming an essential tool for climate modelling. Earth observation data such as satellite observation contribute to a growing record of climate change and weather events, which can be used to build or improve climate models. Deep learning in particular has been widely used in weather forecasting and climate event prediction, such as ENSO. However, other forms of machine learning offer benefits such as interpretability and the integration of physical knowledge from existing climate models. In this Special Session, we invite works on the use of AI for Climate Models; works on model parameter optimization, machine learning for model creation or improvement, and automated analysis of climate data are welcome.

The AI for Climate Science Special Session will be held as a part of the [WCCI](https://2024.ieeewcci.org/) in Yokohama Japan from June 30 to July 5, 2024.

## Scope

We invite submissions that present recent developments in AI for Climate Science. The interdisciplinary scope of the Special Session includes the use of AI in the following topics:
 +  climate modelling
 +  Earth observation
 +  ecosystem monitoring
 +  hybrid data and physics models
 +  weather and climate forecasting
 +  extreme weather events
 +  oceans and marine systems
All AI techniques are welcome, from evolutionary computation to deep learning. Submission should focus on the impact of AI to climate science and highlight the relationship to climate change. We encourage submissions to make their data and code publicly available.
