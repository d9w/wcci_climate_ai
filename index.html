Earth observation data such as satellite observation contribute to a growing record of climate change and weather events, which can be used to build or improve climate models. Deep learning in particular has been widely used in weather forecasting and climate event prediction, such as ENSO. However, other forms of machine learning offer benefits such as interpretability and the integration of physical knowledge from existing climate models. In this Special Session, we invite works on the use of AI for Climate Science; works on climate model parameter optimization, machine learning for climate science, and automated analysis of climate data are welcome.</p><p>The AI for Climate Science Special Session will be held as a part of the <a href=https://2024.ieeewcci.org/>WCCI</a> in Yokohama, Japan from June 30 to July 5, 2024. Details about submission and important dates can be found on their <a href=https://2024.ieeewcci.org>website</a>. Please note that the Special Session may be indicated as &ldquo;AI for Climate Models&rdquo; in the submission system.</p><h2 id=scope>Scope</h2><p>We invite submissions that present recent developments in AI for Climate Science. The interdisciplinary scope of the Special Session includes the use of AI in the following topics:</p><ul><li>climate models</li><li>climate forecasting</li><li>Earth observation</li><li>ecosystem monitoring</li><li>hybrid data and physics models</li><li>weather forecasting</li><li>extreme weather events</li><li>oceans and marine systems</li></ul><p>All AI techniques are welcome, from evolutionary computation to deep learning. Submissions should focus on the impact of AI to climate science and highlight the relationship to climate change. We encourage submissions to make their data and code publicly available.</p><center><img src=climate_models.png alt="Improving climate models and predictions by learning from
